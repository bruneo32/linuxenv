This is my personal linux environment and configuration, it is intended to be a quick partial or complete install in other PCs/VMs for my own sake.

If you like something, you can add it to your own environment!
But please refrain to push changes because this is how I like it and it's intended for me, not for you. Thank you for your understanding.

Although, I would read any ideas and changes via e-mail:
